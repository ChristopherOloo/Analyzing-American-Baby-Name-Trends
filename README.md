# Analyzing-American-Baby-Name-Trends
What makes a name timeless or trendy? In this project, you'll use data published by the U.S. Social Security Administration spanning over a hundred years to understand American baby name tastes.

##Tasks Done in the Project
1. Find names that have been given to over 5,000 babies of either sex every year for the 101 years from 1920 through 2020; recall that names only show up in our dataset when at least 5,000 babies have been given that name in a year.
2. Classify each name's popularity according to the number of years that the name appears in the dataset.
3. Let's take a look at the ten highest-ranked American female names in our dataset.
4. Return a list of first names which meet this friend's baby name criteria.
5. Find the cumulative number of babies named Olivia over the years since the name first appeared in our dataset.
6. Write a query that selects the year and the maximum num of babies given any male name in that year.
7. Using the previous task's code as a subquery, look up the first_name that corresponds to the maximum number of babies given a specific male name in a year.
8. Return a list of first names that have been the top male first name in any year along with a count of the number of years that name has been the top name.
